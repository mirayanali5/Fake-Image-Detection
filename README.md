# Real or Fake: Image Authenticity Detection Using InceptionResnetV1

This project uses a pre-trained resnetinceptionv1_epoch_32.pth checkpoint from Hugging Face, built on the InceptionResnetV1 architecture, to detect whether an image is real or fake. The model is fine-tuned for binary classification and provides an explainability visualization that highlights key areas influencing its prediction.

Users interact with the system through a Gradio interface, where they can upload an image and receive both a classification result and a corresponding heatmap. This tool is useful for digital forensics, media verification, and similar applications where image authenticity matters.
